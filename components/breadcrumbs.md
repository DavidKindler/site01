**Updated Feb 15, 2017:** The breadcrumb component has been modified to be placed in proximity to the Global Nav. This is the first step in adding additional drop-down functionality for each Breadcrumb node. Additionally, the Email & Share Icons have been moved to the [Page Headline](/components/page-headline) Component.
